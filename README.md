# Class Responsibilities
1. MathematicalOperation: A parent class that stores input values and provides a shared calculate() method for arithmetic tasks.
2. Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division: Extend MathematicalOperation and implement their respective arithmetic operations.
3. Shape: A base class for geometric figures that defines methods for computing area and perimeter.
4. Circle, Rectangle: Inherit from Shape and calculate area and perimeter based on their specific dimensions.
5. NumberOperation: A superclass designed for numerical analysis operations.
6. PrimeCheck, Factorial, EvenOdd: Extend NumberOperation to perform specialized number-related computations.

# Inheritance Structure

1. Arithmetic-related classes derive from MathematicalOperation.
2. Geometry-related classes extend Shape.
3. Number analysis classes inherit from NumberOperation.
4. Inheritance promotes code reuse by sharing common attributes and behaviors while allowing subclasses to define their own implementations.

# Encapsulation

1. Encapsulation is achieved by keeping all attributes private and exposing them only through public methods. This protects internal data from direct access and ensures secure and controlled interaction with the system.
